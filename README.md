## Understanding Sports Betting Types in The Locker Room VIP

  

Before diving deeper into this community, it's important to understand the types of bets they focus on and teach members about.

  

### Primary Bet Types Covered

  

**Moneyline Bets**

These are straight-up picks on which team will win the game. The Locker Room VIP often uses moneyline bets when they identify strong underdogs with value. Since moneyline bets don't involve spreads, you just need your team to win outright.

  

**Point Spread Betting**

This is the most common type covered in the community. Point spread bets level the playing field by giving the underdog points and requiring the favorite to win by more than the spread. For example, if Miami is -3.5 against Oklahoma City +3.5, Miami must win by 4 or more points to cover.

  

**Over/Under (Totals)**

The community regularly provides over/under picks based on the combined score of both teams. If an NBA game has a total of 220.5 points, you're betting whether the final combined score will be over or under that number.

  

**Parlay Bets**

The Locker Room VIP is known for their strategic parlay picks. Parlays combine multiple bets into one wager for higher payouts, but all selections must win. They teach members when parlays make sense and when to avoid them.

  

**Proposition Bets**

The experts often share prop bet picks on specific player performances or game events. These might include betting on how many points a player will score or whether there will be a safety in an NFL game.

  

**Futures Bets**

The community covers season-long bets like championship winners or individual awards. These are typically made before seasons start for the best odds.

  

**Live Betting**

The chat becomes especially active during games with live betting opportunities. Members share real-time insights as games unfold, allowing for in-play betting strategies.

  

**Teaser Bets**

These are modified parlays that give bettors better odds on each selection in exchange for lower payouts. The community teaches when teasers provide value, especially in NFL betting.

  

### Legal Considerations for Sports Betting

  

Before joining any sports betting community, it's crucial to understand the legal landscape.

  

**Current US Sports Betting Laws**

  

Sports betting was previously illegal under the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992 (PASPA), with only Delaware, Montana, Nevada, and Oregon exempted.

  

The Supreme Court struck down PASPA in Murphy v. National Collegiate Athletic Association in 2018, opening the door for states to legalize sports betting.

  

As of January 2024, 37 states plus Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico have operational legal sports betting. North Carolina has legalized it but operations will begin later in 2024.

  

30 states plus Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico also allow online sports betting, while 8 states only permit betting through physical sportsbooks.

  

Since the 2018 Supreme Court decision, over $20 billion has been wagered on sports in the United States as of May 2020, and that number has grown significantly since then.
